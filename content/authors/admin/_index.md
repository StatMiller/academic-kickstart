I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.ncsu.edu/) at North Carolina State University and am advised by [Dr. Brian Reich](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~reich/index.html). I am interested in developing Bayesian statistics methods for spatial data, and applying these methods to a variety of fields. In particular, I love collaborating with non-statisticians to apply our work in materials science, political science, and public policy settings. I am a former [NSF SEAS Fellow](https://www.mse.ncsu.edu/seas/traineeship/#custom-tab-0-aa1e3b4f1a47d8195147da18eb4cd9a4), and have provided statistical consulting services to researchers at the Environmental Protection Agency and to an online retailer.
